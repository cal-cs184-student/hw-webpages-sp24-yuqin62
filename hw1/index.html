        <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

        <p>
            In this task, we rasterized the triangles by using the sampling methods described in class.
            First, we defined three vertices for each triangles and checked if they were in the same winding order.
            If they were not in the same winding order, we switched them accordingly.
            This step is essential because it helps determine the direction in which the triangle is facing, which affects how it's rendered and shaded.
            Then, we found the bounding box defined by coordinates x limits and y limits of the vertices using the ceiling and floor of the limits so that
            we don't have to walk through the whole canvas for rasterization. Finally, we implemented the point-in-triangle three-line test, the method introduced in the lecture,
            to determine whether the pixel within the bounding box is inside the triangle. If the pixel is inside the triangle, we fill it with a single color.
            Repeatedly, we could fill all the shapes on the screen.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. This is because what we did was exactly traversing
            from the minimum to the maximum of the bounding box, checking each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.

        <p>
            We tried to make the cubeman do a stretching exercise. We first rotated the torso by 60 degrees and then moved the left arm 5 pixels
            right and 30 pixels up relative to the torso. We also changed the cubeman's customs by modifying the color from
            #EF161F(red) to #00171F(rich black) and the pattern by changing the winding vertices of triangles.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>


        <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

        <p>
            Pixel sampling is to determine the color of pixels on a surface.In our code, we used RasterizerImp::rasterize_textured_triangle function to
            set a triangle, calculate the bounding box, and used Color Texture::sample function set P key for switch the pixel sampling method(sample_nearest and
            sample_bilinear). The two pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear, are similar to the nearest/linear methods in classification models. The P_nearest
            method samples the color by the cloest pixel, and the P_bilinear samples the color by the average_color_weight based on 4 pixels surrounding the target.
            <br />
            <br />
            The test1.svg show a good example that bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling, especially in the 1 sample per pixel case. Here are the
            screenshots using nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and
            bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel. From the images, we found that the 16 samples per pixel images look better than the 1 samples per pixel
            images, and the bilinear sampling performs generally better than the nearest sampling.

        <p>
            We found that generally the bilinear sampling performs better than the nearest sampling, however, in some colorful cases(test3 and test5),
            the two sampling methods appear similar, and when we change sample rate from 1 to 16, the difference between these two sampling methods
            become less pronounced.
        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
        <p>
            Level sampling is a method for mapping texture to screen space with choosing a suitable level for a texture based on (du/dx,dv/dx) and
            (du/dy,dv/dy). For this task, we had an implementation of the Texture::sample method, where we calculated the barycentric coordinates 
            of texture mapping (uv) for 3 points: the target pixel (x,y), and its immediate neighbors (x+1,y) and (x,y+1). These coordinates are 
            in the SampleParams structure as sp.p_uv, sp.p_dx_uv, and sp.p_dy_uv. After that, we proceed to compute the differences between them
            (sp.p_dx_uv - sp.p_uv and sp.p_dy_uv - sp.p_uv) in the Texture::get_level function. This step calculated how quickly the texture details
            change as moving across the surface. We further refined this data by scaling these differential vectors in accordance with the texture's
            full resolution, adjusting them by the texture's width and height. After doing these, we can select the best mipmap level for rendering
            depending on the level sampling method chosen—L_NEAREST for selecting the nearest mipmap level, or L_LINEAR for a linear interpolation 
            between adjacent mipmaps—we can achieve a balance between performance and quality.
            <br />
            <br />
            For pixel sampling, P_nearest is faster and has less memory usage, but may cause the image look more pixelated. P_bilinear needs more
            time and use more memory of computer, but has a better performance on image quality. For level sampling, L_zero is faster and has less memory
            usage than L_nearest and L_linear, since L_nearest and L_linear store multiple mipmaps, but L_nearest and L_linear have better antialiasing
            power to perform image clearer. For number of samples per pixel, increasing the number of samples per pixel improves output quality by averaging
            multiple samples within each pixel, so that improve the image's smoothness. However, this increases memory usage and slow the speed.
            <br />
            <br />
            We chose a picture of Lake Tahoe to compare the  four versions of the image with the combinations of L_ZERO and P_NEAREST, L_ZERO and P_LINEAR,
            L_NEAREST and P_NEAREST, as well as L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR.

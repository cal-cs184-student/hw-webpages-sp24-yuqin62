<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>In this task, we rasterized the triangles by using the sampling methods described in class.
  First, we defined three vertices for each triangles and checked if they were in the same winding order. 
  If they were not in the same winding order, we switched them accordingly. 
  This step is essential because it helps determine the direction in which the triangle is facing, which affects how it's rendered and shaded.
  Then, we found the bounding box defined by coordinates x limits and y limits of the vertices using the ceiling and floor of the limits so that
  we don't have to walk through the whole canvas for rasterization. Finally, we implemented the point-in-triangle three-line test, the method introduced in the lecture, 
  to determine whether the pixel within the bounding box is inside the triangle. If the pixel is inside the triangle, we fill it with a single color.
  Repeatedly, we could fill all the shapes on the screen.
  <br />
  <br />
  Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. This is because what we did was exactly traversing 
  from the minimum to the maximum of the bounding box, checking each sample within the bounding box of the triangle. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>
<p> We tried to make the cubeman do a stretching exercise. We first rotated the torso by 60 degrees and then moved the left arm 5 pixels 
  right and 30 pixels up relative to the torso. We also changed the cubeman's customs by modifying the color from 
  #EF161F(red) to #00171F(rich black) and the pattern by changing the winding vertices of triangles.  </p>
